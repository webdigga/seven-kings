The consultation phase is the foundation of our web design process, where we get to know your business, understand your goals, and outline the project scope. This phase involves in-depth discussions, research, and strategic planning to ensure that the design and development of your website align perfectly with your vision and objectives.

Our journey begins with a thorough understanding of your business, its objectives, and your target audience. During our discovery session, we'll delve deep into your brand identity, values, and the message you wish to convey through your website.

Very simply, this is to go over the basic requirements to make sure I can fulfil what you are asking for.  I'll show some examples of websites I have built previously and explain the content management system and how it all works.
